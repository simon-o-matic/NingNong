Todo

- pass through command line options to ping (captuing the time on the way thru)
- track averages on a 1m/10m/60m basis
- launch web browser to visualize stats
- cancel the first timeout if it actually wasnt (count the number that arrive with the next good ping)
- re-write the timeout code. Need to keep it in sync with ping output
